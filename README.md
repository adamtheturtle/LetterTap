LetterTap
=========

Letter Tap is an implementation of a one-dimensional input keyboard. Inspired by [Jean-Dominique Bauby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Dominique_Bauby) it is primarily and initially meant to be used as an assistive technology. I envision that it will be used by someone who can tap a device without precision to communicate to a carer or loved one nearby, also watching the screen.

Hypothetical uses include other one dimensional input situations such as smart watches, or  assistive devices controlled by facial movements.
